Learning the best ways to build **modern JavaScript apps** is hard. Whether it's web or native, it doesn't matter. There's just **so much you have to learn**.

ES6, ES6+, ES2016, 2017, why do people say JavaScript but mean ECMAScript, what's Babel, where does Webpack fit in, what are `async` and `await` , how does a fat arrow function work, what is `this`, how do I bind a callback, oh wait callbacks are bad, do I use React or Vue, where does jQuery fit in, should I use TypeScript or Flow, why do I care about types anyway?, how do I separate logic from templates, what's a smart component, what does JSX do, should I use imports or requires, how much of this stuff works in the browser anyway, isn't compiling for C++, what's Redux again?

o.O

**Where do you even begin?**

If you're like most, you start at a random spot that piques your interest. Then you read a bunch of random blogs and Stack Overflow answers and Readme files on GitHub and voilÃ¡, 10 years later, you're a pro.

That's why this holiday season 7 expert JavaScript authors got together and designed a coherent learning journey. Go from *"My JavaScript is a little shakey"* all the way to *"I just got a job writing JavaScript for $150,000"*.

**Self-paced learning from 7 expert authors who will answer your email if you have a question.**

You start with the basics of modern JavaScript, continue with React and Redux, learn all about modern build tools, follow it up with native apps, build some shiny examples that would make your mom proud, and finish your journey off with some soft skills that will make you a great engineer to work with.

Separately all of this would add up to more than $1000, but because it's Black Friday and Cyber Monday, you can get it for just **$99 this week**.
