Learning the best ways to build **modern JavaScript apps** is hard. Web or native, doesn't matter. There's just **so much you have to learn**.

ES6, ES6+, ES2016, 2017, why do people say JavaScript but mean ECMAScript, what's Babel, where does Webpack fit in, how do I write a function, why are for loops frowned upon but if you're using `async` and `await` suddenly they're good again, how does a fat arrow function work, what is `this`, how do I bind a callback, oh wait callbacks are bad, do I use React or Vue, where does jQuery fit in, how do I manipulate a Date, should I use TypeScript or Flow, why do I care about types anyway?, how do I separate logic from templates, what's a smart component, what does JSX do, should I use imports or requires, how much of this stuff works in the browser anyway, isn't compiling for C++, what's Redux again?

o.O

**Where do you even begin?**

If you're like most people, you begin at a random spot that first piques your interest. Then you follow a random walk through all the libraries and frameworks and JavaScript features and 10 years later you're a competent engineer/grizzled veteran.

Ask anyone.

They'll share the joys of youth with a tear in their eye. They'll reminisce of times when they could right-click view source on a page and learn how something was built. They'll tell you it's a great way to learn when you're in college or high school and have all the time in the world.

Then they'll say *"You should read a book or follow a course. You ain't got 10 years to learn all this"*

You also can't right-click view source on webapps anymore.

That's why we set out to build a coherent learning journey that takes you from *"I don't know how to JavaScript"* all the way to *"I just got a job writing JavaScript for $150,000"*.

**Self-paced learning from 7 expert authors who will answer your email if you have a question.**

You start with the basics of modern JavaScript, continue with React and Redux, learn all about modern build tools, follow it up with native apps, build some shiny examples that make your mom proud, and finish your journey off with some soft skills that will make you a great engineer to work with.

Normally all this would add up to over $1000, but because it's Black Friday and Cyber Monday you can get it for **$99 just this week**.
