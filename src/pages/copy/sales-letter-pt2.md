I know I know, if all this is worth so much, why are you giving it away almost for free?

Because we believe these books and courses can help many people who otherwise wouldn't be able to afford them. Not everyone has access to a large corporate expense account. We would have loved a deal like this when we were starting out, so we're offering it to you now.

Together, these materials have helped **200,000+** engineers level up their skills, get promotions, and job offers from some of the biggest tech companies in the world.

If you're struggling to keep up with modern JavaScript, or you have a job offer or interview you don't quite feel ready for, give our stuff a try. We keep our books and courses up to date with all the latest discoveries.

And if you don't like it, let us know and we'll refund you 110% of the price.

But you gotta act fast, **sales close Friday December 1st**.
