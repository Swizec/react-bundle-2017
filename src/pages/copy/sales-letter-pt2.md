Together we've **helped over 200,000 engineers** level up their skills, get promotions, and wrangle job offers from some of the biggest tech companies in the world. 

We've seen it all. Every struggle you encounter, every niggle in the road, we've helped someone just like you figure it out.

So why are we giving it to you practically for free?

Because we believe these books and courses can help you. Not everyone has a large expense account or thousands of dollars to spend on improving their skills.

 We would have loved a deal like this when we were starting out, so we're offering it to you now.

If you're struggling to keep up with modern JavaScript, or if you have a job offer or interview you don't quite feel ready for, give our stuff a try. We keep our books and courses up-to-date with all of the latest discoveries.

And if you don't like it, we'll give you a full refund.

But you gotta act fast. **Sales close Friday, December 1st**.
